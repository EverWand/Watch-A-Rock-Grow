# Watch-A-Rock-Grow
Game-a-Week | Week 1

TOPIC: Lose to Win

This game is created designed arounf the meditation, "Watch a Rock Grow," in mind.
Premise of the game is for the player to explore a pointless environment with a rock in the center. The player should think there's a way to have the rock "grow" in some way, but it won't and never will.

Meditation helps overthinkers put themselves in an irrational situation. Though they try to think there way out of it, nothing will change. The point of the meditation is to get thinkers to stop thinking about watching the rock grow and look different perspectives.

CONDITIONS:
Losing = Giving up on finding a way to beat the game.
Win = Accepting that there's no way to beat the game, no matter what they think or do. [Acceptance of the Meditation]
